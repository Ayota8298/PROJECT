  <font color="green" size="5">  Harvard architecture is used when data and code is present in different memory blocks. A separate memory block is needed for data and instruction. Data can be accessed by one memory location and instruction can be accessed by a different location. It has data storage entirely contained within the central processing unit (CPU). A single set of clock cycles is required. The pipeline is possible. It is complex to design. CPU can read and write instructions and process data access. Harvard architecture has different access codes and data address spaces that is, the instruction address zero is not the same as data address zero. Instruction address zero identifies 24-byte value and data address zero identifies 8-byte value which is not the part of the 24-byte value.

  Modified harvard architecture is like a harvard architecture machine and it has a common address space for the separate data and instruction cache. It has digital signal processors that will execute small or highly audio or video algorithms and it is reproducible. Microcontrollers have a small number of programs and data memory and it speeds up the processing by executing parallel instructions and data access.</font>
