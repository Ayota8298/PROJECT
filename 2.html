<font color="green" size="5">  This architecture is proposed by john von-neumann. Now a dayâ€™s computer we are using are based on von-neumann architecture. It is based on some concepts.

The memory we have a single read/write memory available for read and write instructions and data. When we talk about memory, it is nothing but the single location which is used for reading and writing instructions for the data and instructions are also present in it. Data and instructions are stored in a single read/write memory within the computer system.

Each memory has multiple locations and each location has a unique address. We can address the contents of memory by its location irrespective of what type of data and instructions are present in the memory, because of which we can read or write any data and instructions. Execution always occurs in a sequential manner unless the change is required. For example, suppose we are executing an instruction from line 1 to line 10 but now we required to execute line 50 instead of line 11 then we jump to instruction 50 and execute it.</font>
